Bonus
We've set up an executable file for you in bin/time_for_school. Check out the code there and run the file with ruby bin/time_for_school in your terminal. Get a feel for how the code we wrote works and what methods are available to our student and teacher instances thanks to inheritance.

Play around with it a bit more by trying out the following in this file:

a) We have a new user, Jim, who is just here to audit a few classes. He is neither a teacher nor a student. Create a local variable, jim, and point it equal to an instance of the User class. Then, give jim a first and last name. What happens when you try to call #learn on jim?
b) Continue to operate on our student, steve. Have avi teach him some more important knowledge.
c) Create a new student and have that student learn a few things from avi as well.
d) Then, puts out the existing knowledge of each student.
